        <h1>TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY</h1>
        <p>We are living in a time when rapid technological developments are causing profound changes at all levels of 
            society. Each and every profession is affected in some significant way, and because of this, 
            the labour market’s demand for digital competence is increasing.  
            On this page you will get a general understanding of some of the most influential tools and technologies of today.
            I will look deeper into Universal Design and Technology and Sustainability (Kilde, 0.1 What is "Technology and Society"?</p>

        <h2>UNIVERSAL DESIGN</h2>
        <p><a href="https://bufdir.no/uu/?utm_campaign=tema-domener&utm_medium=redirect&utm_source=deltanettet.no&utm_content=deltanettet.no">Universal Desing</a> 
            is the design of products and environments in such a way that they can be used by all people, 
            without the need for adaptation and a special design. Universal design is a strategy for planning and designing 
            products and environments to achieve an inclusive society and with full equality and participation for all. </p>

        <h3>Universal Design for Elderly</h3>
        
        <p>It is especially important with <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915030951">universal design for the elderly</a>, 
            as several medical conditions can occur as you get 
            older. This can be impaired vision, hearing and mobility, loss of strength and endurance. 
            These are factors that can have an impact on one’s ability to perform everyday activities. 
            It is therefore important to take this into consideration when developing new products and websites. 
            <br><br>
            <img src="./assets/co-workers.jpg" alt="">
            When we look at the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915030951?via%3Dihub">basic principles</a>, behind universal design, it clarifies the useful function it can have, 
            especially for the elderly. <br>Below we have presented seven points that can be useful when working with universal 
            design. </p><br>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>1. Simple design that does not require prior knowledge</li>
            <li>2. Easy navigation on websites and products.</li>
            <li>3. Function on websites that facilitate impaired vision and hearing</li>
            <li>4. Easy-to-use manuals using better illustrations and less text</li>
            <li>5. Design with tolerance for errors from the user </li>
            <li>6. Space-efficient appliances that can be placed at home</li>
            <li>7. Advantage of design that require less physical effort as it allows for flexibility</strong></li>

        <h2>TECHNOLOGY AND SUSTAINABILITY</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.smartinnovationnorway.com/nyheter/hva-er-innovasjon-og-hvordan-innoverer-man/">Technological innovations</a> have made great changes in our society, both for better and worse. 
        There is no doubt that electronic devices make both learning and knowledge easier and lighter, 
        but it has its drawbacks that is has a climate cost. </p>

        <h3>Electronic waste</h3>
        <p>Norway is at the top of Europe for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_waste">electronic waste</a>, with <a href="https://www.framtiden.no/202008247613/aktuelt/forbruk/enorme-utslipp-fra-elektronikk.html">28.5 kilos of waste per person</a> per year. 
        In 2018, 1.45 billion mobile phones were sold, and the number for electronic devices continue to rise. 
        This is a big challenge, as it is the <a href="https://www.framtiden.no/201909177473/aktuelt/den-skjulte-kostnaden-av-telefonen-din.html">people and the environment</a>who pay the high price of the consequences. 
        <br><br>

        The waste from electronics and material consume is <a href="https://www.abcnyheter.no/helse-og-livsstil/livet/2020/01/18/195642037/nordmenn-i-verdenstoppen-for-bruk-og-kast-ikke-baerekraftig">not sustainable</a>. 
        The big problem is that the waste from electronics is not recycled well enough. 
        There is a lot that is thrown away, which makes this process far from sustainable. This has led to increased knowledge of the term <a href="https://gronnehint.no/2019/10/11/hvordan-kan-minimalistisk-livsstil-vaere-godt-for-sinnet-kloden-og-klimaet/">minimalist</a> 
        and the lifestyles that comes with it, who believes it creates sustainability. </p>
