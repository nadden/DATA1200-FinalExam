    <h1>LIFE AT OSLOMET</h1>
    <p>There has not been a single day where I did not want to design and be able to create things. I've always knew that I
        would go to University, but to find out what I wanted to study has been one of the biggest challenges.
        I've always wanted to learn to code, but it seemed so difficult and I've been afarid for that this may not be something for me anyway.

            <h2>TRANSITION AND STUDENT LIFE</h2>
            <p>The transition from being a pupil to a student was overwhelming. 
                It was not easy for me to adjust to the new lifestyle. 
                Applied data science was also way outside my comfort zone and I did not have much experience with coding, 
                which led to stress and many negative thoughts about if I was capable to get through my courses. 
                I wondered how I would handle self-study and minimum physical lectures and whether I had enough discipline and smart enough to be able to read and study without having weekly assignments and tests. 
                In addition to moving to a new city where I do not know so many and making new friends.
                <br><br>
                The two sections below I will take you through how I experienced moving and adapting to a new city, 
                and finding a study technique that suited me.

            <h2>ADJUSTING TO A NEW CITY</h2>
            <p>Not everyone chooses or needs to move away from home when they are going to college. 
                I am from a small municipality in Hedmark and did not have much choice. On the other side, 
                I donâ€™t regret moving because I really enjoy seeing and experience new places and 
                I was really looking forward meeting new people in Oslo, but there is no doubt that the coronavirus made 
                this difficult.<br><br>
                On the other hand, I also like to be in my own company and OsloMet has great opportunities 
                to get to know new people through several different societies and academic associations, here, 
                so there are great opportunities to find friends who share the same interest as you!

            <h2>STUDY TECHNIQUES</h2>
            <p>Finding the right study technique is essential and it can save you a lot of time when studying to different 
                courses. On the other hand, it was difficult for me to find the right study technique right away, 
                since the University was something completely different from what I was used to in High School, 
                and I used a lot of time just to keeping up with the schedule and knowing when I had the different courses.
                <br><br> There is no final decision on which study technique to use, as it is very individual. 
                It is therefore important to try at the beginning and not panic if you see that it does not work during 
                the first semester, as this is very normal among students who have just gone from high school to university. 
                <br><br> For me, it has worked very well to spend a lot of time on the resources that OsloMet uses and get to know it, so I know where I can find information, contact people if I need it etc. 
                Also plan my week, keep up with lectures, syllabus and assignments has been essential for me.
